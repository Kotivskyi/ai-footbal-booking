## Additional Considerations

1. **Password Reset / Account Recovery**  
   - If using email/password, a “Forgot Password” flow (or similar recovery mechanism) is standard practice.

2. **Security & Privacy**  
   - Publicly released apps generally require a Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.  
   - Depending on the region, you may need a liability waiver and compliance with data protection laws (e.g., GDPR).

3. **Overlapping Slots**  
   - Decide whether users are restricted to booking only non-overlapping times.  
   - Clarify how the system handles partial or fully overlapping time slots.

4. **Profile Management (Basic vs. Enhanced)**  
   - Some teams include basic profile editing (e.g., display name, avatar) in the MVP.  
   - Consider whether this level of personalization is essential or can wait until after launch.

5. **Venue Selection vs. Single Venue**  
   - If you regularly change locations or have multiple fields, ensure the UX accommodates venue selection.  
   - If it’s always the same field, you may not need this feature right away.

6. **Legal & Compliance (iOS Requirements)**  
   - The App Store typically requires a Privacy Policy link if personal data is collected.  
   - Also ensure you comply with Apple’s Review Guidelines (e.g., data handling, no partial paywalls unless relevant).

7. **Optional Payment Flow**  
   - If you need to collect fees (e.g., field rental costs) or handle cost-splitting, plan a payment flow.  
   - Consider third-party payment gateways or confirm that payments will be handled offline.
