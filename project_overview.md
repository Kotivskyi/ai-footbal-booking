# Project Overview

## 1. Introduction

This project is a **football slot booking application** intended to help players (friends or a small community) easily schedule and manage their football matches. It addresses the problem of disorganized scheduling—often done through group chats or spreadsheets—and replaces it with a simple, centralized platform where users can see available matches, reserve a spot, and manage their bookings.

## 2. Purpose

- **Streamline Booking**: Provide a user-friendly way for players to reserve slots without back-and-forth communication.
- **Fair Distribution of Spots**: Enforce a one-slot-per-user limit (unless canceled) to ensure everyone has a fair chance to play.
- **Reduce No-Shows**: Make it easy to cancel and free up spots if a user can’t attend, so others can step in.

## 3. Main Goals

1. **Core MVP**  
   - **User Registration & Authentication**: Allow users to create accounts and log in.  
   - **View Slots**: Show a list of upcoming football games with date, time, and capacity.  
   - **Book & Cancel**: Enable users to reserve a slot with a single tap and cancel if they can’t attend.  
   - **My Bookings**: Give users a clear overview of their booked games.

2. **Fairness & Simplicity**  
   - **One-Booking Limit**: Prevent users from hoarding multiple slots, ensuring a more balanced chance for everyone to participate.  
   - **Straightforward UX**: Use a minimal and intuitive user interface to reduce complexity.

3. **Scalable Foundation**  
   - **Modular Backend**: Provide a Node.js API that can be extended with new features (e.g., admin tools, notifications).  
   - **Flexible Frontend**: Implement an iOS client that can later integrate optional improvements like waitlists, payment, or calendar syncing.

## 4. Overall Scope

- **Platform**:  
  - **Backend**: Node.js with Express (or similar framework), connected to a database (e.g., MongoDB).  
  - **Mobile App**: iOS (Swift), handling user flows from login to booking management.

- **Core Features (MVP)**:  
  1. **User Registration & Login**  
  2. **View Available Slots**  
  3. **Book a Slot**  
  4. **View My Bookings**  
  5. **Cancel Booking**  
  6. **Booking Limit** (1 active booking)

- **Post-MVP Enhancements** (Potential):  
  1. **Admin Flow**: Create/edit slots, manage capacities, restrict this to certain users.  
  2. **Notifications**: Send reminders or updates about matches.  
  3. **Waitlists**: Queue users if slots are full.  
  4. **Group Booking**: Reserve multiple seats at once.  
  5. **Calendar Integration**: Sync booking times to iOS Calendar.  
  6. **Payment Flow**: Handle field rental or cost splitting if required.  
  7. **Analytics**: Let admins see trends and usage patterns.

## 5. Stakeholders

- **Primary Users (Players)**: The friends or local community members who need to book football matches.  
- **Optional Admins**: Individuals (possibly field coordinators) who can manage available slots and oversee system usage.

## 6. Constraints and Assumptions

- **Time Constraints**: Aim for a quick MVP launch to gather feedback.  
- **Budget Constraints**: Minimize hosting costs (e.g., use free-tier services like Heroku or Render) and limit external dependencies to essential ones.  
- **Platform Constraint**: Initial focus is on iOS devices; Android or web support could be added later.  
- **Data Consistency**: Real-time or near-real-time updates to ensure no overbooking.  
- **Legal & Compliance**: Consider privacy policies and potential disclaimers if publicly released.

## 7. Success Criteria

1. **User Adoption**: The app should replace traditional scheduling methods (group chats, Google Sheets) among the target user group.  
2. **Low Drop-Off**: Users can complete the core flow (login, book, cancel) without confusion.  
3. **Positive Feedback**: Early testers or friends find it easier to coordinate matches compared to older methods.  
4. **Scalability**: Ability to add new features (like admin management, notifications) without rewriting large portions of code.

## 8. Project Roadmap

1. **Phase 1: MVP Development**  
   - Node.js Backend (User, Slot models; booking logic)  
   - iOS Frontend (Swift) with essential screens (Login, Slots, My Bookings)  
   - One-slot booking limit enforced  
   - Initial deployment and internal testing

2. **Phase 2: User Feedback & Iteration**  
   - Collect feedback from the first user group  
   - Fix bugs, improve UI/UX  
   - Refine performance (e.g., caching for quick slot updates)

3. **Phase 3: Additional Features**  
   - Implement admin tools for slot creation/editing  
   - Add notifications or waitlists (if high demand)  
   - Potential integration with an in-app payment system

4. **Phase 4: Scale & Maintenance**  
   - Optimize for increased users/slots  
   - Add analytics dashboard  
   - Expand to other platforms (Android, web) if needed

           | (NoSQL/SQL) |       
           +-------------+

           
iOS App: Communicates with the backend via secure HTTP requests (REST or potentially GraphQL).
Node.js Backend: Processes incoming requests, enforces the one-slot booking rule, and interacts with the database.
Database: Stores users, slots, and bookings data, allowing the backend to quickly query and update records.

. High-Level Stack
Frontend (iOS)

Language: Swift
UI Framework: SwiftUI (modern) or UIKit (traditional)
Networking: URLSession or Alamofire
State Management: Combine (with SwiftUI), or a suitable pattern like MVVM if you prefer UIKit
Backend (Node.js)

Framework: Express (lightweight) or NestJS (opinionated TypeScript framework)
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless auth
Business Logic: Booking logic, enforcing one-slot-per-user rule
Optional: Mongoose (if using MongoDB), Sequelize/TypeORM (if using SQL)
Database

MongoDB (NoSQL) or PostgreSQL (SQL)
Reasoning:
MongoDB pairs well with Node.js (JSON-based).
PostgreSQL is robust for relational data and can handle transactions easily.
Hosting & Deployment

Backend:
Platforms like Heroku, Render, DigitalOcean, or AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, ECS).
Database:
MongoDB Atlas (managed service) or AWS RDS for PostgreSQL/MySQL.
iOS App:
Distributed via TestFlight for beta testing, then App Store for production.
