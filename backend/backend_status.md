# Backend Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing the backend of the football slot booking application.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Functionality (Estimated Time: 1 week)

*   **Task 1.1: Set up the project environment (1 day)**
    *   ✅ Initialize a new Node.js project (`npm init -y`).
    *   ✅ Install core dependencies: `express`, `mongoose`, `cors`, `dotenv`.
    *   ✅ Create basic directory structure (`src`, `config`, `constants`, etc.).
*   **Task 1.2: Database Setup (1 day)**
    *   ✅ Set up a MongoDB database (local configuration).
    *   ✅ Create `config/db.js` to connect to the database.
    *   ✅ Define `User` and `Slot` models in `models/`.
    *   ✅ Add performance optimization (indexes).
*   **Task 1.3: Implement User Authentication (3 days)**
    *   ⏳ Create `authController.js` and `authService.js`.
    *   ⏳ Implement user registration:
        *   Define registration route in `authRoutes.js`.
        *   Implement registration logic in `authController` (handle request, call service).
        *   Implement `registerUser` in `authService` (validate input, hash password with `bcrypt`, save user).
    *   🔲 Implement user login:
        *   Define login route in `authRoutes.js`.
        *   Implement login logic in `authController`.
        *   Implement `loginUser` in `authService` (verify credentials, generate JWT with `jsonwebtoken`).
    *   🔲 Create `authMiddleware.js` to protect routes.
*   **Task 1.4: Basic Slot Management (2 days)**
    *   🔲 Create `bookingController.js` and `bookingService.js`.
    *   🔲 Implement fetching available slots:
        *   Define route in `bookingRoutes.js`.
        *   Implement logic in `bookingController` to fetch slots.
        *   Implement `getAvailableSlots` in `bookingService` to query the database.

## Phase 2: Booking Functionality (Estimated Time: 1 week)

*   **Task 2.1: Implement Booking a Slot (3 days)**
    *   Implement booking logic in `bookingController`:
        *   Define route in `bookingRoutes.js` (protected by `authMiddleware`).
        *   Implement logic to handle booking request.
    *   Implement `bookSlot` in `bookingService`:
        *   Check slot availability (capacity).
        *   Check if the user has an existing booking.
        *   Update the `Slot` document (add user to `bookedBy`).
*   **Task 2.2: Implement Viewing User Bookings (2 days)**
    *   Implement logic in `bookingController`:
        *   Define route in `bookingRoutes.js` (protected by `authMiddleware`).
        *   Implement logic to fetch bookings for the logged-in user.
    *   Implement `getUserBookings` in `bookingService`.
*   **Task 2.3: Implement Canceling a Booking (2 days)**
    *   Implement cancellation logic in `bookingController`:
        *   Define route in `bookingRoutes.js` (protected by `authMiddleware`).
        *   Implement logic to handle cancellation request.
    *   Implement `cancelBooking` in `bookingService`:
        *   Remove the user from the `bookedBy` array in the `Slot` document.

## Phase 3: Enhancements and Refinements (Estimated Time: 1 week - ongoing)

*   **Task 3.1: Input Validation (2 days)**
    *   Implement validation middleware using `express-validator` or similar.
    *   Validate request bodies for registration, login, and booking actions.
*   **Task 3.2: Error Handling and API Responses (2 days)**
    *   Implement consistent error handling.
    *   Create `utils/apiResponse.js` for standardized API responses.
*   **Task 3.3: Testing (3 days - ongoing)**
    *   Set up a testing environment (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
    *   Write unit tests for services and integration tests for controllers.
*   **Task 3.4: Documentation (Ongoing)**
    *   Document API endpoints and data models.
*   **Task 3.5: Refactoring and Optimization (Ongoing)**
    *   Continuously review and refactor code for better readability and performance.

## Dependencies

*   Phase 2 depends on the completion of basic authentication in Phase 1.
*   Input validation and error handling (Phase 3) can be integrated incrementally after core functionalities are implemented.
