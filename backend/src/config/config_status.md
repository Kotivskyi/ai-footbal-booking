### 1. Configuration (`config/`)

*   **Functionality:** Manages the application's configuration settings, primarily the database connection.
*   **Architecture:**
    *   ✅ `db.js`: Contains the logic to connect to the MongoDB database using Mongoose:
        - Handles connection events and disconnection
        - Supports configurable connection options
        - Provides test-specific configuration capability
*   **Tasks:**
    *   ✅ Establish a connection to the MongoDB database upon application startup.
    *   ✅ Handle connection errors gracefully and log them.
    *   ✅ Provide a reusable database connection object.
    *   ✅ Configure database connection with flexible options support

**Next Steps:**
- Add connection event listeners for disconnection handling
- Implement connection pooling configuration if needed
- Add retry logic for connection failures

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests with mongodb-memory-server
- Connection success/failure scenarios
- Run with: `npm test`
